### Basics

#### Variables

JavaScript is a loosely typed language - like Java or C# you don't have to explicitly declare what types of data the variables will hold. The only thing you need to do is to use the `var` keyword.

The most common types of variables in JavaScript are:

* Strings: lines of text. /ie: "hello", "hello world", "The Joy of JavaScript"
* Numbers: numbers include floats and integers. /ie: 22, 5, 140, 3.21, 0.11, 1, 5.02342
* Boolean: simply a true or false and nothing else
* Arrays: a collection of values
* Objects: one of the most common data types, represents more complex data
* undefined: when you use an object property that does not exist, or a variable that has been declared, nor assigned a value
* null: a variable that contains no valid data type

#### Comments

Comments help the developer to explain JavaScript code, make it more readable or to prevent execution.
JavaScript supports two types of comments:

Single Line:

``` javascript
var a = "I am string";
//this line will be ignored by the interpreter
var b = 32.1
```

Multiline:
 
``` javascript 
/* this is a multiline comment and will
be ignored by the interpreter
*/
var foo = function (num) {...};
```
